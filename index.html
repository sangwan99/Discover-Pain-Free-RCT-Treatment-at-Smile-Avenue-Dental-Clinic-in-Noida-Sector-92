                </div>
                <p class=" mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">Your journey begins with a thorough examination by one of our skilled dentists. They will assess the condition of your tooth using advanced diagnostic tools such as digital X-rays. This helps in determining the extent of infection or damage that necessitates RCT.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="flex flex-col mt-10">
                <div class=" sm:py-4 border-gray-200 sm:border-t-0 border-t mt-0 sm:mt-0 text-left sm:text-left">

                </div>
                <p class=" mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">Once the diagnosis is confirmed, local anesthesia is administered to numb the affected area. This ensures that you remain comfortable throughout the procedure and experience minimal discomfort.</p>
            </div>

                </div>
                <p class=" mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">After numbing the area, our dentist creates a small access hole in the tooth to reach the infected pulp chamber. This step allows for the removal of infected tissue and bacteria.</p>

                </div>
                <p class=" mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">Using specialized instruments, our dentists carefully clean and shape the root canals to remove all traces of infection. This meticulous process ensures that the canals are prepared to receive a filling material.</p>

                </div>
                <p class=" mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">Once cleaned, the root canals are filled with a biocompatible material called gutta-percha. This material seals the canals to prevent re-infection and supports the structure of the tooth.</p>

                </div>
                <p class=" mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">After completing the root canal treatment, our dentist will recommend restoring the tooth with a crown or filling, depending on the extent of damage. This step aims to strengthen the tooth and restore its functionality.</p>
